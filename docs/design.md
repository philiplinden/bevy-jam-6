# Powder Game - Bevy Edition

Inspired by the original [Powder Game](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/),
 [The Powder Toy](https://powdertoy.co.uk/), and
[Sandspiel](https://sandspiel.club/), this project aims to recreate the game
using the Bevy game engine. The goal is to provide a similar experience with
enhanced features and performance. It is a learning project for Bevy and Rust,
focusing on game development, physics simulation, and user interaction.

This game is created as part of [Bevy Jam 6](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-6).
